# Minesweeper-to-be
So, this is an attempt at me building a semi interactive GUI of sorts, through the game minesweeper. 
I'm not insane with python but this seems mostly functional, I'll be practicing more with this in my free time.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code, using the Python coding language. I learned using the tkinter module and it was a lot of fun :)
